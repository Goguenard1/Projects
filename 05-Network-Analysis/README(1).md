# Network Analysis of Social Graphs with Node Attributes

This project explores the structure and properties of social networks using **Python** and **NetworkX**.
It focuses on graph construction, statistical analysis, and visualization, with particular attention to
**node attributes** such as gender and core membership.

The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook and provides an exploratory approach to understanding
social network topology through graph theory.
